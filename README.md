# NewsNow - IT3048C
Vyviene Spaulding, Alex Hedges, Francesca Suba
## Introduction
Inspired by the spontaneous app sensation, BeReal, NewsNow sends a singular, daily notification. It is sent at a different time each day and will prompt the user to read an article (posted within 24 hours of the notification) from a reputable source. NewsNow will track the user's "ReadStreak" with a counter, which signifies how many days in a row the user has stayed up to date on current events. The user will also have an option to refresh the page for a new article if they wish to keep reading. NewsNow's mission is to encourage users to keep track of what is happening around the nation, one article, one day at a time.
